## The Perfect Being

I really recommend watching this [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SARbwvhupQ). So, we will be talking about something that people in all professions with all levels of experience face. 

The fear of failure. 
 
We will go over 3 questions.
1. What causes the fear of failure?
2. Why do we fail *repeatedly*?
3. What can we do about it?


## What causes the fear of failure?

The fear of failure comes from the fact that we tend to think of ourselves as *perfect* beings. In other words, *geniuses*. Why do we think that? Well that comes from another fear of thinking that *if we are to make a mistake, we are stupid*. Perhaps, this is a survival instict. Nevertheless, it is what causes us to *fear* failure. Nobody, *especially the stupid* want's to be *percieved* as dumb. And perception is truth.

It is convenient to think of ourselves as perfect and not *try* so as to not *fail*.


## Why do we fail repeatedly?

This comes from the fact that we think we are perfect. And so anything that we do *must be perfect*. A perfect being will be doing things perfectly. This leads us to thinking that if at all we do something and fail. That it is not that we are doing something *wrong*, but that the *circumstances* have led to a *different* outcome. Leading us into a vicious "cycle of failure".

### The cycle of failure
1. You have an idea you think is *perfect*. Hence, you refuse to acknowledge there might be a mistake.
2. You implement it.
4. You fail, so you think you should "try again", cause the "circumstances".

The main problem here is thinking that the *first idea* you have is perfect.
