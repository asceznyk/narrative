## The Incompetent Genius

I really recommend watching this [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SARbwvhupQ). So, we will be talking about something that people in all professions with all levels of experience face. 

The fear of failure. 
 
We will go over 3 questions.
1. What causes the fear of failure?
2. Why do we fail *repeatedly*?
3. What can we do about it?
