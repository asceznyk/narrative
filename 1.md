## The Perfect Being

I highly recommend watching this [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SARbwvhupQ). We will be talking about something that people in all professions with all levels of experience face. 

The fear of failure. 
 
We will go over 3 questions.
1. What causes the fear of failure?
2. Why do we fail *repeatedly*?
3. What can we do about them?


## What causes the fear of failure?

The fear of failure comes from the fact that we tend to think of ourselves as *perfect* beings. In other words, *geniuses*. Why do we think that? Well that comes from another fear of thinking that *if we are to make a mistake, we are stupid*. Perhaps, this is a survival instict. Nevertheless, it is what causes us to *fear* failure. Nobody, *especially the stupid* want's to be *percieved* as dumb. And perception is truth.

It is convenient to think of ourselves as perfect and not *try* so as to not *fail*.


## Why do we fail repeatedly?

This comes from the fact that we think we are perfect. And so anything that we do *must be perfect*. A perfect being will be doing things perfectly. This leads us to thinking that if at all we do something and fail. That it is not that we are doing something *wrong*, but that the *circumstances* have led to a *different* outcome. Leading us into a vicious "algorithm of failure".

### The algorithm of failure
1. You get an idea after hours of contemplation. 
2. You work hard to implement it.
3. You test your work, and seemingly there is some initial success.
4. You have developed a sense of *pride*, because you were "successful".
5. You fail miserably, so you think you should "try again", cause the "circumstances".
6. You refuse to acknowlede the mistakes, because you painstakingly spent so much *time* and *energy* coming up with the idea.
7. You repeat steps 4-6 over and over.

The main problem here starts with step 4, and the way it affects step 6. The more pride you have in the *first idea*, the longer it will take you to accept your mistakes. The longer it takes you to accept your mistakes. The more you fail.


## What can we do about them?

First let's think about why these questions were asked in the first place. Why are these questions important? How does answering them help? Well, what cripples us is not our false assumption of inability. It is fear. Fear cripples the best of us. Knowing it, is the first step to conquering it. 

So what can we do about them? 

### the fear of failure
The truth is, you're not a *genius*. Even if you are, there will be someone else who *will* outsmart you. You're certainly not *perfect*. Hence, the first step is to accept it. Accept that you're not a *genius*. It simply doesn't matter, *especially* when you're solving problems.

### failing repeatedly

After admitting to the fact that you're *not* a genius. It is natural to accept the fact that your ideas *will not* be perfect. Even if your idea is seemingly perfect, there will be someone else's idea which is *more perfect*. 

After that, it is about knowing that the pride that you have developed over the hours of working on something is not going to *solve* your problem. In fact it adds to it. Hence, it is a good idea to *swallow the pride*, and try something different.

First, simply assume that the first idea you get is *wrong*. Try to refute it. Keep refuting different ideas iteratively until you find one that is *irrefutable*. Or just read up someone else's idea on how to do it. Again it is not that you are not capable of doing it, it is that you're simply not a genius.
